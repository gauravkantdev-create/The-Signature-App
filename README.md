Digital Signature App ✍️ (JavaScript Project)

This project is a responsive digital signature web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, download, and manage digital signatures easily with a clean and intuitive interface.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Responsive Design – Works smoothly across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
✅ Digital Signature Canvas – Draw your signature using mouse or touch.
✅ Custom Background & Text Size – Change background color and adjust text size as per your preference.
✅ Three Core Buttons:

🧹 Clear – Clears the entire signature area.

💾 Download – Downloads your signature as an image file.

🔄 Retrieve – Retrieves the last deleted signature (only for the most recent downloaded image).

⚙️ Note: The “Retrieve” button only restores the most recently deleted signature after download. It doesn’t retrieve older saved images — it’s a one-time retrieval feature.
